ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

StayFit is a web application that helps users start and track their fitness journey. StayFit comes with a BMI calculator, a mini-exercise wiki, and an intuitive workout planner. The BMI calculator allows users to set a starting point, providing info to the users on what they need to work towards. The mini-exercise wiki allows users to get a better understanding of certain exercises, with a gif showing the proper form, a small description of the exercise, and a link to find out more. The planner builds a day-by-day workout routine, allowing users to enter any exercise they want and specify the sets and reps for any day of the week. StayFit also has a register feature, in which users who want to save or access their info may sign up or log in to the website.

HOW IT WAS BUILT:

The front-end was developed using React, primarily in jsx, html and css. The back-end uses a MySQL database, Express.js, node.js, as well as a JSON file.
